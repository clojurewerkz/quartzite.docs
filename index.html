    <h2>Powerful</h2>
    <p>Quartzite is based on the <a href="http://quartz-scheduler.org/">Quartz Scheduler</a>, one of the most powerful and feature rich open source scheduling tools.
      Support for sophisticated schedules, multiple calendars, Cron expressions, clustering, plugins and more.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='span4'>
    <h2>Expressive DSL</h2>
    <p>Quartzite provides an expressive Clojure DSL for defining jobs, schedules, triggers and tying them together</p>
  </div>

  <div class='span4'>
    <h2>Persistent Storage</h2>
    <p>Quartz supports pluggable persistence engines that preserve scheduler state between application restarts and crashes.
       JDBC adapters are provided out of the box, several others (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/michaelklishin/quartz-mongodb">MongoDB Quartz store</a>) are available as 3rd party libraries.</p>

  <div class='span4'>
    <h2>Dynamic</h2>
    <p>Unlike periodically running file-based tools, Quartzite lets you manage operations and schedules via API, query the scheduler and visualize scheduler state
    on the Web or in a mobile application easily.</p>
  </div>

  <div class='span4'>
    <h2>Battle Tested</h2>
    <p><a href="http://quartz-scheduler.org/">Quartz Scheduler</a> is a very battle tested project used actively by many commercial and open source projects, large and small.
       Quartzite is a very thin layer on top of that and benefits directly from that maturity.</p>
